          <span className="font-bold">LIGHTNING FAST.</span> The M1 chip
          delivers speed to tackle any all-day workflow, with a big leap in CPU,
          GPU, and machine learning performance. The iMac 24-inch delivers
          impressive performance in an incredibly thin design. The new iMac
          features a 24-inch 4.5K Retina display with 11.3 million pixels, 500
          nits of brightness, and over a billion colors.

          It has a 1080p FaceTime camera, studio-quality mics, and a six-speaker
          sound system â€” the best camera and audio ever in a Mac. Touch ID comes
          to iMac, making it easier than ever to securely log in, make
          purchases, switch user profiles, and more. The new iMac joins the
          family of Mac models powered by M1, including MacBook Air, 13-inch
          MacBook Pro, and Mac mini, marking another step forward in Apple's
          transition to Apple silicon.
        </p>
        <p className="text-muted-foreground">
          Combining the power of M1 with macOS Big Sur, the new iMac instantly
          wakes from sleep, everyday tasks feel noticeably faster and fluid, and
          apps launch with amazing speed. The 8-core CPU delivers up to 85
          percent faster performance than the previous generation, while the
          7-core or 8-core GPU delivers up to 2x faster graphics performance.
